# Note Taker

## Description

This project is an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This application will also be deployed to Heroku.

- It was great opportunity to take part to imrove starter code to make app work.
- I have some issue to create delete function but sort in the end.
- I lean about Express.js how to get , post and delete data and about json file.
